                    <h2>SUMMARY FLOW OF RECRUITMENT</h2>
                    <h2>JOB POSITION CREATION</h2>
                    <p font-size:medium>Hiring manager can create the Job Position. In the Job Position, Hiring Manager will select the department, Job location and Number of New employees (Expected New Employees) and then he needs to select the recruitment manager’s name and Hiring Manager (in case the job position needs to be assigned to someone else). It will automatically reflect in the Job Application.
                    <img src="static/l.png" alt="" width="1000"><br>
                    After creating the Job Position it will go for approval. Only a HOD can approve this after checking the details. To approve a Job Position HOD needs to go to Configuration and select “Job Position Needs to be approved” and just click on the Approve Button.
                    <img src="static/m.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Admin needs to give HR HOD access rights as the HOD. To give the HOD access, Admin needs to go to the settings and select the employee and click on the HR HOD option and save it.
                    <img src="static/n.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    <img src="static/o.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    And the HOD will find the Approve option on the Top Left corner of the system. He needs to just click on it and the Position will be activated
                    <img src="static/p.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once the HOD approves the Job Position, it will change the state to “Recruitment in Progress”
                    <img src="static/q.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Now Recruitment Manager can check all the active job position and starts the recruiting process
                    <img src="static/r.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    <h2 id="hr1">JOB APPLICATION</h2>
                    This is the Kanban View of Job Application. All applications are visible here stage wise.
                    <img src="static/s.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    In the Recruitment process, Recruiter will add/create an application and fill the candidate details and Interviewer details. The Recruitment Manager can also attach the CV of the applicant
                    <img src="static/t.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    <img src="static/1.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    <h2 id="hr2">CV SELECTION AND SCHEDULE MEETING</h2>
                    The next stage is CV selection stage, in this stage Recruitment Manager and Hiring Manager can reject or approve the candidate for the next stage which is Technical Interview 1.
                    <img src="static/2.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once the candidate’s CV gets approved then the Recruiter just needs to click on the Approve button and stage will change.
                    <img src="static/3.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Recruiter can schedule a meeting for the Technical Interview 1 and Interviewer 1 and candidate will get mail of interview.
                    <img src="static/4.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Here Recruiter can select Attendees and time of interview and Reminder for the interview.
                    <img src="static/5.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Recruitment Manager will fill the common IRS Comments - Current CTC, Expected etc..
                    <img src="static/6.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    And then this initial information will automatically get populated in every IRS. There is no need to fill it every time. The salary details will be visible only to the second interviewer.
                    <h2 id="hr3">INTERVIEW 1</h2>
                    Once Interviewer 1 logs in the IRS button will be visible and the system will allow the creation of the IRS. Interviewer 1 will create the IRS for the candidate and submit it.
                    <img src="static/7.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    The default IRS comments will be visible automatically in IRS form from the main form.
                    <img src="static/8.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Interviewer 1 will give ratings to the candidate
                    <img src="static/9.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Interviewer 2 is different so Interviewer 1 cannot create IRS for Technical Interview 2. Access rights to check IRS is role wise so the Interviewer 1 cannot see IRS of Interviewer 2.
                    <img src="static/10.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    As can be seen in the screenshot, here Interviewer 2 name is mentioned so only he can process for technical Interview 2.
                    <img src="static/11.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once Interviewer 2 logs in then he can create an IRS for round 2 and Interviewer 2 has the right to check the IRS of Interviewer 1 also.
                    <img src="static/12.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    System will retrieve all the details from the main page related to the IRS on Interviewer 2 IRS page and Interviewer 2 will give rating for the second round.
                    <img src="static/13.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Interviewer 2 can check the IRS from the smart button.
                    Interviewer 2 cannot check the HR Interview.
                    <img src="static/14.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    HR needs to follow the same process for the HR round. HR will login and fill the IRS for the HR Interview round.
                    <img src="static/15.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Here, we can see HR’s IRS on the smart button. HR has access to check the IRS of Interviewer 1 and 2 as well.
                    <img src="static/16.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    In the candidate selection stage, the recruitment manager can reject or approve the candidate as per the internal decision.
                    <img src="static/17.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once Recruiter approves the candidate the system will show the option to create the offer letter
                    <img src="static/18.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    <h2 id="hr4">OFFER LETTER</h2>
                    After preparing the offer letter, the recruiter needs to send that offer letter for the approval to the HOD. The recruiter needs to click on the Send Email to HOD and the system will send the offer letter for approval.
                    <img src="static/19.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    The HOD will receive the mail to approve the offer letter. HOD needs to click on the Approve button. Once the offer letter is approved the recruitment manager would get the option to release the offer letter to the candidate. The screenshot below shows a sample offer letter email as received by the candidate.
                    <img src="static/20.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Candidate can then accept the offer letter and the application will then move to the offer accepted stage.
                    <img src="static/21.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once the offer has been accepted by the candidate, the system will show this Accepted tag on the Offer letter screen.
                    <img src="static/22.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    In Job Application, the system will automatically change the stage to Offer Accepted stage once a candidate accepts the offer.
                    <img src="static/23.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once the offer letter is accepted the applicant will move to the “Candidate engagement” stage. In that stage Recruiter can send mail to candidates for different activities like document submission etc.
                    <img src="static/24.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once approved at this stage the applicant will move to employee creation where we will get an option to create an employee.
                    <img src="static/25.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once an employee is created then the concerned departments would get notification mail with the name of the employee so they can start the onboarding process.
                    <img src="static/26.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>

                    <h1 id="hr9">LEAVE MANAGEMENT</h1>
                    Leave is an important factor to an employee and thus the leave management is an essential and inevitable factor in organization. Leave management module is intuitive and helps the HR people to handle their work in a much easier format.

                    The basic concept of leave management is as follows- each employee can create their own leave request which shall be approved or rejected by the officer or concerned representative. Here, the employee can select the different leave types which are already created in the system. Officer of the concerned department can approve all the requests raised by employees in that department and itself acts as an employee to request for its own leaves. The administrator has all access rights and can manage all activities. 
                    <h2>LEAVE REPORTS</h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>THE COMMON LEAVE REPORTS TYPE ARE :</h2>
                    <b>Current leave balance :</b> This helps to know current leave balance
                    <b>Day wise check In/Out :</b> This helps to identify in and out time of employees.
                    <b>Leaves taken monthly :</b> To identify how many leaves are taken in a month.
                    <img src="static/62.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Time off type defines the kind of leaves the individual is taking, whether it's paid, unpaid, Sick, etc. 
                    <img src="static/63.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    It will calculate the probation date based on the date of joining. All the leaves remain zero till the probation period. As probation ends the system will automatically calculate all the leaves.
                    <img src="static/64.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    For applying for New Time off, the employee needs to go to the Leave module and select New Time off as shown in the screenshot below
                    <img src="static/65.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    The system would then ask for the required inputs such as Leave type, duration of the leave and comments. The employee needs to provide all the required information and submit the application for manager’s approval
                    <img src="static/66.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    Once approved by the Manager the leave will also be reflected in the Timesheets for the concerned employee
                    For a Leave allocation (E.g. Compensatory off) the employee needs to go to New allocation
                    <img src="static/67.png" alt="" width="1000" ><br>
                    The system would ask the employee for the required details. Once the details are submitted the application will go to the manager for approval. Once the application is approved the leave balance will get credited to the employee. The comp needs to be exhausted within 90 days of approval
