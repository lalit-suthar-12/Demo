By introducing sales module in SecurEyes ERP platform, the automation process has begun right from the word GO. Sales module has made the entire sales process a real-time operation and has paved ways for making sales department fully automated and readily available.

                    <h3>5.1 LEAD:</h3>
                    <p>A lead is the first step of the sales funnel. A Lead in Odoo may be an enquiry for services from a prospective customer or a contact. In other words, a Lead is a potential customer who expresses interest in our services through various means of communication e.g., e-mail, phone call, etc. When a client makes an enquiry about our services, that can be defined as a LEAD. This Lead may have a chance to become an Opportunity later.

                    Depending on the business workflow and needs, we may require assigning the incoming new LEADS to different sales team or even to specific salesperson to take it further. Where the same activity done manually can be tedious and time consuming – and hence to mitigate and expedite the process, Odoo CRM allows you to automate the process of LEAD Assignation based on specific criteria such as location, etc. With specific workflows and precise rules, we will be able to distribute all our LEADS / OPPORTUNITIY automatically to the right sales teams and/or salesman.</p>

                    <p>In the lead creation form, the user can select a customer and link that customer to this lead. It is also possible to create a customer profile dynamically if there is no customer record exists in your system. There are some optional fields such as email, contact name, job position, mobile, phone, fax, etc. are available. The corresponding salesperson’s details who creates this lead will be automatically filled.</p>

                    <p>An Opportunity can be viewed with a high probability for closing. This step is the immediate next step after a Lead is created and conferred as a Prospect. A sales Opportunity is a qualified prospect who has a high probability of becoming a customer and hence, it carries more weightage than a Lead.
                    Lead is an unqualified contact, while an Opportunity is a qualified contact moving to the sales Process. Hence, to turn a Lead into an Opportunity/Prospect, one has to take the Lead through the Sales Qualification Process to assess if our services are sought by the prospective customer.</p>

                The user can convert a Lead to Opportunity and track it more efficiently from the pipeline. To convert a created lead to opportunity, go to:-  Leads, select the lead and click convert to opportunity.

                If user select the conversion action ‘Convert to opportunity’, then a new opportunity will be created. If ‘Merge with existing opportunities’ is selected, then a new option will appear which will allow user to select the opportunities.

                This opportunity can be assigned to a salesperson and his team. While creating the opportunities, it is optional to link it with a customer. If user select the option ‘Do not link with a customer’, then no customer will be linked with. There are other options available to link with an existing customer or to create a new customer and link with him.
                Instead of converting a lead to an opportunity User can also create an opportunity directly from Sales to My Pipeline to Create<br>
